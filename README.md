# Network-Infrastructure
A combined repo for my IT2035C – Networking Infrastructure Management class labs (Cisco Packet Tracer).
Lab 2 – Basic routed network with DHCP
Lab 3 – Routed network with DHCP, DNS, and HTTP (PCs resolve soit.edu to the DMZ web server)

**Lab 2 – DHCP (overview)
Single router with multiple LANs
Server provides DHCP scopes for each LAN
PCs obtain addresses dynamically (no static IPs on clients)
Validation checklist
PCs show DHCP-assigned IP, mask, gateway, DNS
ping between subnets succeeds
Router interfaces are up/up

**Lab 3 - DHCP, DNS and HTTP (overview)
